QtQuick 2.0 port of the ZXing multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library

Based on the great work done in the [original QtQuick 1.0 port][] by [Nikolaos Ftylitakis][].

This repo essentially makes it possible to use the [ZXing][] 1D/2D barcode decoding library in projects
based on the Qt 5.x framework.
